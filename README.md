# FastAPIapp
small crud app with FastAPI

if you want to test this app you have to start the python file with a uvicorn server.you do this with the following command: "uvicorn main:app --reload", 
if you don't have uvicorn installed yet just do it with "sudo apt install uvicorn".
under the route "localhost:8000/docs" you can now call the app and test it.
